# Architecture Review and Refinement for Poker Hands Library in Rust/WASM

## Review of Current Design

The proposed architecture for the Rust/WASM implementation of the poker hands library is based on the following components:

1. **Module Structure**:

   - `card.rs`: Card data structure and operations
   - `hand.rs`: Hand data structure and detection algorithms
   - `combinatorics.rs`: Combinatorial functions
   - `deck.rs`: Deck creation and shuffling
   - `odds.rs`: Odds and probability calculations
   - `lib.rs`: Entry point for the WASM module
   - `errors.rs`: Error handling and custom error types
   - `tests/`: Test suite for the Rust implementation

2. **Data Structures**:

   - `Card`: Representation of a playing card with suit and value
   - `Hand`: Collection of cards with detection methods
   - `Deck`: Collection of cards with shuffling capabilities

3. **WASM Integration**:

   - Use `wasm-bindgen` for FFI between JavaScript and Rust
   - Define public APIs with `#[wasm_bindgen]` attributes
   - Implement error handling with `Result` types

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Use bitflags for efficient suit/value representation
   - Implement bitwise operations for hand detection
   - Minimize memory allocations with stack-based data structures

## Refinements and Additional Considerations

1. **Error Handling**:

   - Consider using `thiserror` crate for more ergonomic error handling
   - Implement custom error types for card/hand validation
   - Provide meaningful error messages for FFI boundaries

2. **Memory Management**:

   - Ensure proper memory management for WASM exports
   - Use `wasm-bindgen` types for safe data transfer between JS and WASM
   - Minimize memory allocations with stack-based data structures

3. **Testing Strategy**:

   - Implement unit tests for individual components
   - Implement integration tests for cross-language functionality
   - Implement performance benchmarks for critical paths

4. **Documentation**:

   - Add Rust doc comments for public APIs
   - Create documentation for WASM bindings
   - Provide examples for JavaScript integration

5. **Build Configuration**:
   - Configure `Cargo.toml` for WASM target
   - Set up build scripts for generating JS bindings
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

## Next Steps

1. Implement the proposed architecture in Rust
2. Integrate with WASM using `wasm-bindgen`
3. Implement performance optimizations
4. Implement unit and integration tests
5. Document the implementation and provide examples for JavaScript integration
6. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
