# poker-hands

A library of functions for handling texas hold-em poker games and more.

## Why?

This is a coding work-out, practicing writing library code instead of applications.

## See also

Inspired and tested against the online calculator [ProPokerTools](http://www.propokertools.com/simulations) and the CLI [poker-odds](https://github.com/CookPete/poker-odds). If you want to calculate hand equity, both tools are strictly better than this one.
